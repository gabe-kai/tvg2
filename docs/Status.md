## Daily Commit Summaries

- 2025.03.31:  Created folder structure and starting documentation. Developed PipelineDesign.md + 3 layer-specific pipeline docs. Scaffolded core data models for the planet generation pipeline.
- 2025.04.01:  Implement custom logging. Implement Feature: generate-mesh-pipeline. Implement Feature: planetbin-export.
- 2025.04.02:  Create custom feature project_layout_manager.
- 2025.04.03:  Update the ProjectLayout and a lot of descriptions. Built the standalone mesh viewer, phase 1 (simple).
- 2025.04.07:  Built Overlay system. Built Toolbar: wireframe, rotation lock, & auto-rotate.
- 2025.04.08:  Added Face ID overlay. Added Icosphere Mesh relaxer.

## In-Progress and Next-Up

- Active Bug: I suspect that half of the normals on my generated icosphere are inverted, probably the hemisphere that starts farthest from the camera.

[X] Minimal working viewer that can display a mesh
[ ] Add modular overlay system to visualize mesh metadata
[ ] Enable live debug viewing during planet generation or standalone use

## Critical Conventions
### Python File Notes
- Start every python file with a line-1 comment displaying the relative path and filename.
- Ensure that every class, method, and function has a docstring.
- Use inline comments extensively to explain what things do.
- Put imports at the top of the file, not above the function / method that uses it. Sort the imports into groups by function.
- Don't name anything `__main__.py` or `config.py`, those are reserved. Use names specific to the feature or utility.

### Logging System
Use the project logger, not Pythonâ€™s default logging.getLogger(), when building or updating files.

Import via:
```python
from shared.logging.logger import get_logger
log = get_logger(__name__)
```

Use log.debug(), log.info(), log.warning(), etc. as needed.
For detailed tracing during debugging, use log.trace() (lower than debug).

Logging is configured automatically; no setup is needed in each file.
When building logging for unit tests, put the logs in tests/logs/, not in logs/ or in test-specific folders.
