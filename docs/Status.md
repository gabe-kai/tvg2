## Critical Conventions
### Python File Notes
- Start every python file with a line-1 comment displaying the relative path and filename.
- Ensure that every class, method, and function has a docstring.
- Use inline comments extensively to explain what things do.
- Put imports at the top of the file, not above the function / method that uses it. Sort the imports into groups by function.

### Logging System
Use the project logger, not Pythonâ€™s default logging.getLogger(), when building or updating files.

Import via:
```python
from shared.logging.logger import get_logger
log = get_logger(__name__)
```

Use log.debug(), log.info(), log.warning(), etc. as needed.
For detailed tracing during debugging, use log.trace() (lower than debug).

Logging is configured automatically; no setup is needed in each file.
