## Critical Conventions
### Python File Notes
- Start every python file with a line-1 comment displaying the relative path and filename.
- Ensure that every class, method, and function has a docstring.
- Use inline comments extensively to explain what things do.
- Put imports at the top of the file, not above the function / method that uses it. Sort the imports into groups by function.

### Logging System
TBD (but it is critical!)
