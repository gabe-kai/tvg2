# SimulatePlateMotion â€“ Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the `SimulatePlateMotion` stage of the planet generation pipeline.
It is divided into five substeps, each building on the previous one. Each section includes its purpose, data structures, and implementation notes.

---

## 3.1 Expand Craton Regions

### ðŸ§­ Purpose
Expand each craton from its seed face (center index) into a stable region that will serve as the tectonic root of a plate.

### ðŸ“¦ Inputs
- `Planet.mesh`: MeshData (faces, adjacency)
- `Planet.cratons`: list[Craton] with `center_index: int`

### ðŸ—‚ Output
- `Craton.face_ids`: List[int] of face indices for each craton's region

### ðŸ›  Implementation Notes
- Use BFS from each craton's center face
- Use `planet.mesh.adjacency` to get neighbors
- Consider hard limit (e.g., radius or number of faces per craton)
- Store results directly on `Craton.face_ids`
- Prevent overlapping by tracking claimed faces across all cratons

---

## 3.2 Seed Plates From Cratons

### ðŸ§­ Purpose
Create a tectonic plate for each craton, initializing plate data and linking them to their craton seed.

### ðŸ“¦ Inputs
- Expanded craton data with populated `face_ids`

### ðŸ—‚ Output
- `Planet.plates`: list[Plate] with:
  - `id: int`
  - `craton_id: int`
  - `has_craton: bool`
  - `craton_face_count: int`
  - `id: int`
  - `craton_id: int`
  - `seed_faces: List[int]` (usually same as craton face_ids)

### ðŸ›  Implementation Notes
- One plate per craton (1:1)
- Set `has_craton = True` and `craton_face_count = len(craton.face_ids)`
- This metadata will help classify plates later (e.g. continental vs. oceanic in Step 4)
- Assign sequential IDs
- Store face assignments temporarily in plate object or in a plate map
- Track global `plate_id_per_face: List[int]` (unassigned = -1)

## 3.3 Grow Plates

### ðŸ”€ Strategy Overview
Plate growth can be implemented using different strategies, selectable via `get_strategy()` in the pipeline module. The following strategies are proposed:

#### Strategy 1: Weighted BFS with Randomness *(default)*
- Grows plates from their seed faces using BFS, but with randomized weights.
- Weight factors can include:
  - Random bias
  - Number of already-claimed neighbors
  - Directional expansion bias
- Produces mildly irregular shapes, easy to control.

#### Strategy 2: Voronoi-Style Competition
- All plates grow in lockstep, competing for unclaimed neighboring faces.
- In each round, eligible frontier faces are gathered.
- Claims are decided based on:
  - Distance to plate seed
  - Random weighting or noise field
- Allows long, irregular, jagged shapes with more realism.

#### Strategy 3: Multiple Seed Expansion *(extension of Strategy 1 or 2)*
- Each plate can grow from multiple seed faces (e.g., craton center + peripheral seeds).
- Encourages branching shapes, plate fragmentation, and natural irregularity.
- May be combined with Strategy 1 or 2 as a modifier.

#### Strategy 4: Repulsion-Based Sprawl *(experimental)*
- Each plate emits a pressure field or 'growth force'.
- Faces with high local density of competing plates repel further claims.
- Can simulate stretched or uneven growth patterns.
- Most computationally expensive.


Expand each plate from its craton seed region to cover the rest of the mesh.

### ðŸ“¦ Inputs
- Plate list with seed faces
- Face adjacency map

### ðŸ—‚ Output
- `plate_id_per_face: List[int]` of length `num_faces`

### ðŸ›  Implementation Notes
- Default: Use Strategy 1 (Weighted BFS with Randomness)
- Support multiple strategies via factory: `get_strategy("weighted_bfs")`, `get_strategy("voronoi")`, etc.
- Maintain a global frontier queue per plate or simulate competitive wavefronts
- Prevent overlap: once a face is claimed, it is locked
- Allow configuration of randomness intensity, bias direction, and frontier priorities
- Maintain a global frontier queue per plate
- Prevent overlap: once a face is claimed, it is locked
- Prioritize balance and even spread (e.g., avoid overly dominant plates)

## 3.4 Detect Plate Boundaries

### ðŸ§­ Purpose
Identify borders between neighboring plates by examining adjacent faces.

### ðŸ“¦ Inputs
- `plate_id_per_face`
- `planet.mesh.adjacency`

### ðŸ—‚ Output
- `Planet.plate_map`: PlateMap with boundary information
- Optional: face-to-face edge pairs for visualization

### ðŸ›  Implementation Notes
- For each face, check its neighbors
- If any neighbor belongs to a different plate â†’ boundary
- Store boundary data as list of edge pairs or in an edge graph

---

## 3.5 Assign Plate Motion Vectors

### ðŸ§­ Purpose
Give each plate a motion vector used later to generate elevation and simulate tectonics.

### ðŸ“¦ Inputs
- `Planet.plates`

### ðŸ—‚ Output
- Each plate gains:
  - `motion_vector: np.ndarray (3,)` (unit vector)
  - `speed: float` (optional)

### ðŸ›  Implementation Notes
- Use random vectors or generate structured motion fields
- Normalize all vectors
- Store directly in the `Plate` object
- Later stages (e.g., Elevation) will use these vectors

Each substep is implemented as its own module under `pipeline/simulate_plate_motion/`.
See `PlanetPipeline.md` for stage integration details.
