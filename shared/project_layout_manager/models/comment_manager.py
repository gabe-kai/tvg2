    Merges manual changes from the ASCII tree (parsed_nodes) into the existing node list (current_nodes).
    - If a node appears in both sets, its description is updated to match whatever is in parsed_nodes
      (assuming the manual ASCII tree is the "source of truth" for new comments).
    - If you want to handle newly introduced or removed nodes, you could reconcile them too, but usually
      this is handled by scanning and the standard update_state_with_changes. Here we focus on merging
      comments/annotations, particularly for removed items.
